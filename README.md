# Casting Actors for Your Movie
## Can the Process of Casting Actors Be Automated?
<br>

## Abstract
Casting is the process of selecting actors who will play various characters in a movie. Typically, a casting director is hired to find the best possible talent for the roles and present these options to the directors and producers who then make their final casting decisions. Casting is one of the most crucial parts of the filmmaking process; choosing the actors can make or break a film. Choosing the wrong actor might diminish a particular character’s believability, which would affect negatively the movie. However, even the best casting directors have a certain bias from their experience in the industry; this can come from their previous interactions with actors (or lack thereof). This project aims to predict how successful an actor would be if they were cast in a specific role. This allows to rank the actors by the most appropriate for the role to the least appropriate, which would serve as casting suggestions to the directors and producers.

Casting is one of the most crucial parts of the filmmaking process; choosing the actors can make or break a film. Our project aims to use data about actors’ personal information and previous roles to predict how successful they would be in a new role. This can allow for making casting suggestions to help casting directors pick out who to call in for an audition. In order to measure how successful an actor will be in a new role, we investigate the relationship between the success of actors and the success of the movies that they played in, and the similarity (or not) of the different roles a successful actor played in; the personas of the characters that actors played can be leveraged from plot summaries of the movies by using NLP tools.

## Research Questions
- Does hiring the best actors guarantee a successful movie?
  'Best actor' here refers to the actors who were awarded an Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as it is hard to quantify how good an actor is apart from leveraging the opinion of other professionals in the field. 
  A movie is said to be successful if it has a high rating by the general audience and the critics.
- Do the best actors play the same roles over and over again?
  There's a strong association in the general viewer's mind between some actors and the characters they portray as their roles are minor variations of each other, whereas other actors' range of characters played is very wide. We are interested in seeing whether the best actors tend to do the former or the latter. 
- How can you pick the most appropriate actor for your movie?
  The main question in this project is finding the best actors suited for a role. The role is described by the persona of the character, and by other distinctive information like age, gender, ethnicity,..
